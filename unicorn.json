She grew up with just her mother because her father went to jail. She went to community college but felt that community college did not bring anything to the table. She was able to quit her job, and start her startup. She also loves collaborating with other people and listening to what other people have to say. This is why a lot of her workers love to work with her. She is what people define as a hustler and more of a Mark Zuckerberg type. ",

There he partied a lot and did not go to class much. When he got into the real world, he started to realize it is necessary to work hard to succeed once he got out of school. Once he started work, he was fired multiple times by big companies. Eventually, he wanted to start his own company with his colleagues and friends, to build more of a family dynamic in the new company. He is like Richard Branson. Though he hustles, having a good time is the most essential thing for him. ",
