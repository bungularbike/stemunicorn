She grew up with just her mother because her father went to jail. She went to community college but felt that community college did not bring anything to the table. She was able to quit her job, and start her startup. She also loves collaborating with other people and listening to what other people have to say. This is why a lot of her workers love to work with her. She is what people define as a hustler and more of a Mark Zuckerberg type. ",

			"description": "Lucas is a Thai 25-year-old male. He is from a middle-class family. He did not get the best grades in school and went to a mediocre school. There he partied a lot and did not go to class much. When he got into the real world, he started to realize it is necessary to work hard to succeed once he got out of school. Once he started work, he was fired multiple times by big companies. Eventually, he wanted to start his own company with his colleagues and friends, to build more of a family dynamic in the new company. He is like Richard Branson. Though he hustles, having a good time is the most essential thing for him. ",

He excelled in everything he had done, including getting perfect grades, getting in Stanford with a full scholarship. He had even built multiple apps and companies before and sold them for millions of dollars. Right now he is building his new venture and is aspiring to make this company take over the world. He works every day till 8 o clock at night and sometimes sleeps at the office. Because of his commitment to work he doesn’t have much of social life. He is what people call a nerd because he almost has no social skills, but his work ethic is unmatched. He aspires to be more like Steve Jobs. ",
